          We are excited to announce that Shalom is taking on his new role as
          Safeguarding Officer at 1000 Hills Rugby! Over the past 10 years,
          Shalom has grown with us, starting from tag rugby to the development
          team, then the senior team, and now as a coach for the development
          team. He is a true example of success and dedication. As he said in
          his words, "I will work with the team to create a safe environment for
          children and everyone in our programs, and I will ensure our policies
          are clear and understood by all our stakeholders." We are proud of
          Shalom and his commitment to making a positive impact! <br />

          The Women National League, One of a kind for our women's team

          For years, we dreamed of the day our women’s team would take their
          place on the big stage. That day has finally come! For the first time
          ever, 1000 Hills Rugby will be represented in the Women Nation League.
          It’s hard to believe that not long ago, many of these players were too
          young to participate, and we didn’t even have a senior women’s team to
          compete. But through passion, perseverance, and countless hours of
          hard work, these incredible women have grown into a team ready to make
          history. This isn’t just about rugby—it’s about breaking barriers and
          showing the power of determination. The journey begins now, and we
          couldn’t be prouder!
